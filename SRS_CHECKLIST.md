## Summary
- **Must-have (§3) fully met:** FR-1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.8, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.3, 3.5, 3.7, 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 5.1, 5.2, 5.5.
- **Must-have gaps (block UAT sign-off):** **FR-2.6 (password reset)**, **FR-3.4 (guest checkout)** — both are "Must" and currently missing. FR-1.5 map is "Must" but partial.
- **Should/Could:** largely partial or future (search/filter, email/SMS, role enforcement, audit logging, bulk enquiry, reconciliation, multi-language, document download).

**Conclusion:** The platform is structurally complete and demonstrable, but **two SRS "Must" items (FR-2.6, FR-3.4) and the live MoMo test (SRS §8 acceptance) must be delivered before UAT sign-off.**
