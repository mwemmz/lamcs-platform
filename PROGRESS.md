**Date:** 2026-07-07
**Status:** Active development — UI/UX overhaul complete; core functionality implemented; pre-launch hardening + acceptance testing remaining.

## 1. What Has Been Done

### 1.1 Design System Overhaul (UI/UX)
The original system suffered from a near-white base (`#FBF8F1`) with white glass cards, causing low contrast and washed-out brand colors. A full "orchard" design system was implemented:

- **Color tokens** (`globals.css` `:root`): warm sand base `#E8E1CC`, tinted cream surface `#F4F0E4`, deeper recessed surface `#DBD2BA`, deep avocado-skin green `#354026`, avocado-flesh `#84A24F`, pit-brown accent `#9C5523`, warm line `#C6BDA2`.
- **Glass surfaces retuned** to tinted cream (not white) with green-tinted borders and deeper shadows.
- **Body texture** changed from stark dots to a subtle avocado/pit radial wash.
- **Brand color blocks** introduced: pit-brown panels (home final CTA, About membership), avocado-skin panels (hero, governance, footer).
- **Reduced-motion support** added (`prefers-reduced-motion` disables reveals/lifts).
- **Reusable components** added/improved:
  - `Reveal` (IntersectionObserver scroll-reveal)
  - `StatusBadge` + `statusTone` (centralized, on-brand status colors; replaces scattered Tailwind status classes)
  - `Button` variants expanded: `primary`, `secondary`, `ghost-light`, `ghost-pit`, `solid-white` (fixes a class-conflict bug that made "Learn More"/"Contact Us" buttons invisible).
- **Hero contrast** reworked: headline cream, subtext avocado-flesh, CTAs pit/cream — all high-contrast against the dark-green hero.

### 1.2 Public Marketing Site (`/`)
- Home, About, Produce, News, Gallery, Contact pages built and styled.
- Responsive layouts, scroll-reveal, brand panels applied.

### 1.3 Member Portal (`/portal`)
- Login (phone + password), Dashboard, Profile (view/edit), Contributions, Payments — all built and wired to APIs.

### 1.4 E-Commerce (`/produce`, `/cart`, `/checkout`)
- Produce listing page, product detail, cart, checkout flow built.
- Order creation, order status updates, MoMo payment initiation + webhook/status routes present.

### 1.5 Admin Back-Office (`/admin`)
- Login (email + password), Dashboard (metrics), Members (CRUD), Listings (CRUD), Orders (status management), Payments, Content (CMS), Reports (CSV export) — all built.

### 1.6 Data & Auth Layer
- Prisma schema with `Member`, `Contribution`, `Payout`, `ProduceListing`, `Order`, `OrderItem`, `Payment`, `AdminUser` (with `AdminRole` enum), `ContentPage`, `AuditLog`.
- NextAuth Credentials providers (member-login by phone, admin-login by email), bcrypt password hashing, JWT sessions (8h timeout).
- MTN MoMo payment provider integration (sandbox + production env support), with initiate / status / webhook routes.
- Rate-limiting utility present.

### 1.7 Quality
- `tsc --noEmit` passes with **0 errors** (a pre-existing null-guard bug in `(shop)/produce/[id]` was also fixed).

## 2. What Remains

### 2.1 Functional Gaps vs SRS (see `SRS_CHECKLIST.md` for detail)
- **FR-2.6** Password reset / account recovery — **not implemented**.
- **FR-3.4** Guest checkout — **not implemented** (buyers must register).
- **FR-3.6 / 5.3** Email/SMS notifications on new orders — **not implemented**.
- **FR-1.5** Embedded map on Contact page — **not implemented** (address/phone/email present).
- **FR-5.4** Fine-grained role-based access (Super Admin / Content Editor / Sales Manager) — only coarse admin-vs-member gating exists.
- **FR-5.6** Audit log writes — model exists but not wired into admin actions.
- **FR-3.8** Bulk/wholesale exporter enquiry — data model supports `isBulk` but no distinct flow.
- **FR-4.4** Payment reconciliation view — partial (payments list exists).
- **FR-1.7 / 2.7 / 4.5** Multi-language, document downloads, additional payment methods — future-phase (Could/Should).

### 2.2 Pre-Launch Hardening
- **Real MoMo integration test** with a live merchant/collection account (currently sandbox/config-gated).
- **Admin role enforcement** and **audit-log instrumentation**.
- **Security review**: verify CSRF/XSS protections, session timeout config, input validation on all routes.
- **Performance**: confirm 3G/4G load targets, image optimization for low-bandwidth Zambia.
- **Accessibility**: automated + manual contrast/keyboard audit (design now targets AA; verify programmatically).
- **Backups** of SQLite DB automated.
- **HTTPS / hosting** setup.
- **Training** of designated Cooperative admin staff.
- **UAT sign-off** by Cooperative representative.

### 2.3 Content & Assets
- Replace placeholder imagery (Unsplash hero, "Photo N" gallery, placeholder product images) with real farm photography.
- Seed real produce listings, news, and member data.
- Confirm brand assets (logo, exact colors) with Cooperative.

## 3. Next Recommended Steps
1. Implement **password reset** (FR-2.6) — highest-priority missing Must.
2. Implement **guest checkout** (FR-3.4) or formally defer.
3. Wire **admin role checks** + **audit logging**.
4. Add **email/SMS** notifications (FR-3.6).
5. Run a full UAT pass against `SRS_CHECKLIST.md`.
